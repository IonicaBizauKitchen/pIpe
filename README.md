## pIpe

ifttt is awesome for popular channels like Twitter, Facebook, Email etc. But if you want to customize channels to use any json or xml feed it isn't of much help.

pIpe is ifttt for websites/webservices linked to webservices/smartphones/laptops with advanced filters.

It is the ultimate in web automation. See [Hacker News Gtalk Alert](https://github.com/sathish316/pIpe/blob/master/examples/hacker_news_gtalk_alert.rb) for example

Source can be:

1. Any json feed
2. Any xml/rss feed
3. Any website with changes detected from html
4. Twitter

Events can be notified to:

1. Any webservice
2. Desktop notifications like Growl
3. iPhone / Android
4. Email, Instant Message, Text Message
5. Twitter, Google Calendar, Todo lists etc

pIpe has advanced filters and is not limited to one input and output.

It is still a work in progress. To contribute fork and check out unfinished Sources, Sinks, Inputs, Outputs
